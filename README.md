#COVID-19 Stats Tracker

Objectives:
Display current Covid-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations completed.

Steps:
Using the requests module, we access data from COVIDActNow API
Export the data into a csv object to be loaded into Pandas
Transform data into a dataframe using Pandas
Fine-tune Pandas in order to show (for speed) only the data requested
Plot the data using matplotlib (testing purposes before front end) 
Serve the information to end-user using Django (server), HTML/CSS
(Possibly use Javascript for front-end interactive aesthetics.
